Flavor Recipe App

Flavor is a web application for sharing and discovering recipes. Users can register, log in, create recipes, view their profiles, add comments, and filter recipes by cuisine, time, or ingredients. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while the backend uses Nest.js with Prisma for database management.
